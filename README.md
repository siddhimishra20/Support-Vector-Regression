# Support-Vector-Regression
This project demonstrates the use of Support Vector Regression (SVR) to predict the profit of startups based on various features such as R&amp;D Spend, Administration, Marketing Spend, and State. SVR, a powerful machine learning algorithm, is used to model non-linear relationships between independent variables and the dependent variable (profit).
